    "# Neural Networks Step by Step\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Introduction to Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network is a type of machine learning model inspired by the human brain. It is made up of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons), which can learn to recognize patterns in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use neural networks?\n",
    "- They can learn complex relationships in data.\n",
    "- They are used in image recognition, language translation, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Terms\n",
    "- **Neuron**: A single unit in the network that processes input.\n",
    "- **Layer**: A group of neurons. Networks have input, hidden, and output layers.\n",
    "- **Weights**: Parameters that adjust as the network learns.\n",
    "- **Activation Function**: Decides if a neuron should be activated.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: The Perceptron (the simplest neural network)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build a perceptron to understand the basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perceptron function\n",
    "def perceptron(x, w, b):\n",
    "    z = np.dot(x, w) + b\n",
    "    return 1 if z > 0 else 0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example inputs\n",
    "x = np.array([1, 0])  # Input features\n",
    "w = np.array([0.5, -0.6])  # Weights\n",
    "b = 0.1  # Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "output = perceptron(x, w, b)\n",
    "print(f\"Perceptron output: {output}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `x` is the input vector.\n",
    "- `w` is the weights vector.\n",
    "- `b` is the bias.\n",
    "- The perceptron computes a weighted sum and applies a step function.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Building a Simple Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build a neural network with one hidden layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Simple neural network with 1 hidden layer\n",
    "\n",
    "def sigmoid(x):\n",
    "    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Input\n",
    "X = np.array([[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,1]])\n",
    "# Output (XOR problem)\n",
    "y = np.array([[0],[1],[1],[0]])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize weights\n",
    "np.random.seed(42)\n",
    "W1 = np.random.randn(2, 2)\n",
    "B1 = np.zeros((1, 2))\n",
    "W2 = np.random.randn(2, 1)\n",
    "B2 = np.zeros((1, 1))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Forward pass\n",
    "def forward(X):\n",
    "    Z1 = np.dot(X, W1) + B1\n",
    "    A1 = sigmoid(Z1)\n",
    "    Z2 = np.dot(A1, W2) + B2\n",
    "    A2 = sigmoid(Z2)\n",
    "    return A2\n",
    "\n",
    "output = forward(X)\n",
    "print(\"Network output:\\n\", output)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- We use the sigmoid activation function.\n",
    "- The network has an input layer, one hidden layer, and an output layer.\n",
    "- We randomly initialize weights and biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Training a Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "Training means adjusting weights to minimize error. This is done using backpropagation and a loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Loss function (Mean Squared Error)\n",
    "def mse(y_true, y_pred):\n",
    "    return ((y_true - y_pred) ** 2).mean()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example loss\n",
    "y_pred = forward(X)\n",
    "loss = mse(y, y_pred)\n",
    "print(f\"Loss: {loss}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- The loss function measures how well the network predicts the output.\n",
    "- Lower loss means better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Using a Framework (Keras)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use Keras to build a neural network easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "from tensorflow import keras\n",
    "from tensorflow.keras import layers\n",
    "\n",
    "# Build model\n",
    "model = keras.Sequential([\n",
    "    layers.Dense(2, activation='sigmoid', input_shape=(2,)),\n",
    "    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')\n",
    "])\n",
    "\n",
    "model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')\n",
    "model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, verbose=0)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Predictions:\", model.predict(X))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- Keras makes it easy to build and train neural networks.\n",
    "- We define layers, compile the model, and fit it to data.\n",
